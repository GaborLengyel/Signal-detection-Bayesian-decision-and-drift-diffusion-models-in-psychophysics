# Signal-detection-Bayesian-decision-and-drift-diffusion-models-in-psychophysics

This jupyter noteboob explains the relationship between the classical Signal Detection, Bayesian Decison, and Drift Diffusion models in psychophysical experiments. Under the assumption of Gaussian noise, all three models predict the very same cummulative Gaussian function explaining accuracy data in perceptual discrimination tasks.
